    <p id="hold">I'll Hold You Lightly - Lyrics:<br />
        I'll hold you lightly my darling<br />
        I'll hold you lightly my dear<br />
        And though my arms love to hold you<br />
        My heart has God above to fear
    </p>
    <p id="rings">Paper Rings - Lyrics:<br />
        The moon is high<br />
        Like your friends were the night that we first met<br />
        Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet<br />
        Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
    </p>
    <p id="dancing">Dancing in the Moonlight - Lyrics:<br />
        We get it on most every night<br />
        And when that ol' moon gets so big and bright<br />
        It's a supernatural delight<br />
        Everybody was dancing in the moonlight<br />
    </p>
    <p id="friend">My Best Friend - Lyrics:<br />
        I never had no one, that I could count on,<br />
        I've been let down so many times<br />
        And I was tired of hurtin', so tired of searchin'<br />
        Till you walked into my life<br />
        It was a feeling, I'd never known<br />
        And for the first time, I didn't feel alone<br />
    </p>
    <p id="somebody">To Love Somebody - Lyrics:<br/>
        There's a light
        A certain kind of light
        That never shone on me
        I want my life to be
        Lived with you
        Lived with you</p>

    <p id="ride">Ride - Lyrics:<br />
        I just wanna stay in the sun where I find<br />
        I know it's hard sometimes<br />
        Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind<br />
        I know it's hard sometimes<br />
        Yeah, I think about the end just way too much<br />
        But it's fun to fantasize<br />
        On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was<br />
        But it's fun to fantasize<br />
    </p>
    <p id="me">ME! - Lyrics:<br />
        I promise that you'll never find another like me<br />
        I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh<br />
        I know I never think before I jump<br />
        And you're the kind of guy the ladies want<br />
        (And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)<br />
        I know that I went psycho on the phone<br />
        I never leave well enough alone<br />
        And trouble's gonna follow where I go<br />
        (And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)<br />
    </p>
    <p id="street">Mulberry Street - Lyrics:<br />
        One, two, three, yeah<br />
        Ah, ah<br />
        Keep your bliss, there's nothing wrong with this, no (Wrong with this, no)<br />
        Ah-ah-ah-ah, yeah, whoo-ooh<br />
        Keep your bliss, there's nothing wrong with this, no (Wrong with this, no)
    </p>
    <p id="shake">Shake it Off - Lyrics:<br />
        I stay out too late<br />
        Got nothin' in my brain<br />
        That's what people say, mmm-mmm<br />
        That's what people say, mmm-mmm<br />
        I go on too many dates (Haha)<br />
        But I can't make them stay<br />
        At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm<br />
        That's what people say, mmm-mmm<br />

    <p id="saturday">Saturday - Lyrics:<br />
        Slow down on Monday<br />
        Not a sound on Wednesday, yeah<br />

        But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday<br />
        We paint the town<br />
